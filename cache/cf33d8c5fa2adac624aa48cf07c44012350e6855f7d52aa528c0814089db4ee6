When regressing on explanatory variables, the objective is to differentiate the individual effects of each x variable on the output variable y, holding all else constant. However, if "],["‚Åç",[["e","x_1"]]],[" and "],["‚Åç",[["e","x_2"]]],[" are correlated, it's hard to interpret the effect of "],["‚Åç",[["e","x_1 "]]],[" on "],["‚Åç",[["e","y"]]],[" holding all else constant, since "],["‚Åç",[["e","x_2"]]],[" is very likely to change according to "],["‚Åç",[["e","x_1"]]],["'s change.
